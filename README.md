# Siphox Health Technical Interview Project

This project is a demonstration of my skills and capabilities for a technical interview with Siphox Health. It is built using React with TypeScript and incorporates SCSS for styling. The project setup ensures a consistent development environment and showcases best practices in modern web development.

#### Observations

- Case Sensitivity: Please note that the values used in the project are case sensitive. Ensure that you enter values exactly as expected.

- Conditional Navigation Between Questions: The bonus point on conditional navigation between questions is somewhat open-ended. Here are a couple of interpretations:

  - Navigation Control: Changing between questions based on user actions, such as moving forward or backward through the quiz.
  - Dynamic Rendering: Displaying questions based on user responses or categories, potentially rendering different questions based on previous answers or user profiles.

If you have more specific details or examples about what is expected for this feature, please let me know so I can address it accurately.
